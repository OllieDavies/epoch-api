# epoch-api

### Getting started

Install dependencies

```
npm install
```

Start the API

```
npm start
```

This will expose the API at http://localhost:8000

### Run tests

Unit tests are implemented with Jest. Run the tests with:

```
npm test
```

### Next steps

- Add CI integration (Circle, CodeSuite, etc.)
- Deploy to EC2
- Replace fixed API key with safer authentication (e.g. JWT)
- Add integration tests for whole app
- Tighten CORS configuration
